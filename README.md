# MarioBrosClone
A first year university project where we had to re-create a mario-like game using SDL.

# About The Project
We were tasked to create a Mario-like game in C++ using an framework known as SDL. I decided to create the first two levels of super mario bros. I am quite happy with the overall product as at the time, I was still very new to C++
